--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenArchX is a deep learning framework designed for efficient model training and inference, with support for CUDA operations using CuPy. This framework is built to be independent of PyTorch while providing similar functionalities.

You can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to extend OpenArchX when needed.

Our trunk health (Continuous Integration signals) can be found at [your-ci-url](https://tnsaai.com/).

## More About OpenArchX

[Learn the basics of OpenArchX](https://oax.tnsaai.com/#examples)

At a granular level, OpenArchX is a library that consists of the following components:

| Component | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| [**Tensor**](https://oax.tnsaai.com/) | A Tensor library like NumPy, with strong GPU support |
| [**Autograd**](https://oax.tnsaai.com/) | A tape-based automatic differentiation library that supports all differentiable Tensor operations |
| [**Neural Networks**](oax.tnsaai.com/) | A neural networks library deeply integrated with autograd designed for maximum flexibility |

Usually, OpenArchX is used either as:

- A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs.
- A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.

### A GPU-Ready Tensor Library

OpenArchX provides Tensors that can live either on the CPU or the GPU and accelerates the computation significantly.

We provide a wide variety of tensor routines to accelerate and fit your scientific computation needs such as slicing, indexing, mathematical operations, and linear algebra.

### Dynamic Neural Networks: Tape-Based Autograd

OpenArchX has a unique way of building neural networks using a tape-based autograd system, allowing for dynamic changes in network behavior without overhead.

### Python First

OpenArchX is built to be deeply integrated into Python, allowing you to use it naturally like you would use NumPy or SciPy.

### Imperative Experiences

OpenArchX is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, providing straightforward error messages and stack traces.

### Fast and Lean

OpenArchX has minimal framework overhead and integrates acceleration libraries to maximize speed.

### Extensions Without Pain

Writing new neural network modules or interfacing with OpenArchX's Tensor API is designed to be straightforward and with minimal abstractions.

## Installation

### Binaries

Commands to install binaries via Conda or pip wheels are on our website: [https://example.com/install](https://example.com/install)

### From Source

#### Prerequisites

If you are installing from source, you will need:
- Python 3.8 or later
- A compiler that fully supports C++17

#### Get the OpenArchX Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OpenArchX.git
cd OpenArchX
```

#### Install Dependencies
